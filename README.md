# *GUCCI MANE: TRIVIA*
Gucci Mane is a critically acclaimed artist hailing from Atlanta, Georgia. He has been cited as the most influential rapper within the last decade, maybe of all time. You can see his influence in the musical landscape and street culture. As **Noisey's** David Drake explains, 
> "The reason Gucci inspires so much writing here has to do with the nature of his  art—that its impact has been so massive, yet operates by different rules, its  relationship with its fans so historically unique. Though his albums have sold  respectably, they haven't touched the numbers of rappers like Lil Wayne or Drake.  Yet he became about as huge as a street rapper could be without ever transforming  into a mainstream star. Some continue to argue that it's "just turn-up music"—a  perspective that ignores huge swaths of the rapper's back catalog, minimizing him to the kind of cynical hitseeker who clogs up radio. This ignores the ways in which  his multifaceted art is dense with narrative contradiction and limned in pathos.  Recently, Gucci's music, while competent, is much less urgent than it was for the  first five years of his career. Yet over the course of the past decade, he has remained one of hip-hop's most significant and central voices, an artist with a  discography so vast and intricate we've barely scratched the surface, and whose influence tumbles forward like dominos through the new generation."
